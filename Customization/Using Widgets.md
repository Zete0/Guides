# Using Widgets
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

Widgets are part of the core building blocks of BAR and handle many of the core visual mechanics including many of the settings!
- Players can create their own widgets, but must be made pubically available within the [widgets discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/549281623154229250/1113845509891829810)
- **Widgets that are not made available in the discord channel break the [CoC - Section B4 - Unfair Advantages](https://www.beyondallreason.info/code-of-conduct)**
- Widgets that can influence the course of battle are also frowned upon, but not banned at this time
<br>

- All widgets are written in lua and can be edited with a text editor
- Widgets are usually disabled for tournament play
<br>

## Installation

**To install a widget, place the *.lua* file within *Beyond-All-Reason\data\LuaUI\Widgets*.**

You will probably need to create the widgets folder, widgets that come with the game are elsewhere, so this spot is just for custom widgets

***NOTE:** Some of the widgets shown here may or may not be available in the future*

### After the file is placed in your folder, you may need to turn the widget on

To turn the widget on, in game, type */widgetselector* (or F11 if your widget setting is turned on) to bring up the widget menu

Widgets marked in red are off, green/yellow are on

You may need to refresh the lua script by typing */luaui reload* (game will pause momentarily while it refreshes)

You can also edit the widget file to adjust the behavior to your liking

#### Use Widgets at your own risk! Not all widgets are perfect and could screw something up

If you wish to remove a widget, bring up the widget menu and turn it off or remove the file. You may need to refresh lua or restart the game for it to take effect in some cases
