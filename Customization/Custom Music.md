# Setting Up Custom Music
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

BAR uses semi-dynamic music based on how much fighting is going on

When the game starts, the music is more peaceful and as the game intensifies, it becomes heavier

You too can create a custom playlist to play at these specific times

## Installation

Custom music files must be in *.MP3* or *.ogg* format
Once you have them in the proper format locate the custom music folder - *...\Beyond-All-Reason\data\music\custom*

![Custom Music Path](https://github.com/Zete0/Guides/assets/47950648/bd8fc5b0-ab09-4424-9cbd-aeb3086359ff)
Here, you'll see a collection of folders that indicate when to play each playlist

Simply place your music within the sub-folders

**Peace** - *Files here will be played when there is very little to no combat*<br>
**WarLow** - *Files here will play in low intensity combat*<br>
**WarHigh** - *Files here will play in higher intensity combat*<br>
**War** - *Files here will play in both low and high intensity combat*<br>
**BossFight** - *Files here will play in final boss battle in Raptors and Scavengers gamemodes*<br>
**GameOver** - *Files here will play on the results screen*<br>
**Menu** - *Files here will play while in the lobby*<br>
**Loading** - *Files here will play during the loadscreen*

<sup> Music that is placed within the custom folder itself automatically get added to all playlists</sup>

### Enable Your Music in Game

After you've played your music in the appropriate folders, you many need to adjust your music settings - you can turn on/off the default and custom playlist, and individual tracks themselves

If your music does not show up with custom music on, you may need to restart the game or you may have your music in an incompatible file format
