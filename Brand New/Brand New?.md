# New to Beyond All Reason?
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

Beyond All Reason (**BAR**) is an up and coming, open source, __free to play__, Real-Time Strategy game.
It is currently in **Alpha** and is working towards a steam release.

Like Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihilation, it's roots stem from Cavedog's 1997 game **Total Annihilation**. It has a lineage steming from the spring engine, similar to Zero-K, but gameplay more similar to the original Total Annihilation and Balanced Annihilation.

If you come from these similar games, here's a guide with you in mind:

## Have questions about the game? Ask a Mentor!

Within the Discord, feel free to ask any question you may have in the [Academy-Chat Channel](https://discord.com/channels/549281623154229250/1090730219356307496). Fellow players and **Mentors** will answer your questions, free of judgement.

Mentors are experienced players with plenty of game knowledge who are willing to help new players learn the game. To become a mentor, they must pass a test to become certified, so you know you can trust their responses.

Mentors have a Mentor badge that looks like this: ![image](https://github.com/Zete0/Guides/assets/47950648/89dea2ee-e40a-45ad-a7ab-a06b97c7a91d)

### Beyond answering questions, Mentors also help coach by:
- **Reviewing submitted Replays**
	- *(To do this, create a thread within #academy-chat, upload your replay there, and ping @Mentor so all the mentors see the request)*
- **One on One Chat Sessions**
- **Hosting Events**
	- *Sometimes, mentors will host what we call a "clinic", or an event that covers one particular topic*
