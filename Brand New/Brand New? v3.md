# New to Beyond All Reason?

Beyond All Reason (**BAR**) is an up and coming, open source, __free to play__, Real-Time Strategy game.
It is currently in **Alpha** and is working towards a steam release.

Like Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihilation, it's roots stem from Cavedog's 1997 game Total Annihilation. It has a lineage steming from the spring engine, similar to Zero-K, but gameplay more similar to the original Total Annihilation and Balanced Annihilation.

If you come from these similar games, here's a guide with that in mind:
