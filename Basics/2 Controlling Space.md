# Controlling Space
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

## Fundementals

#### Controlling more space allows us to control more metal nodes, thus improving our economy. The more nodes we control and the more we can deny our enemies from having nodes, the stronger our economy will be, allowing us to eventually destroy them because we now have more units.

#### By understanding these core principles below, we should be able to effectively control space on any map in any position
#### Remember, our ultimate goal is to build our economy as quickly as possible so we may field more units, so we can defend our territory and deny territory for our opponent(s)

## Core Principles - Establish a Frontline:
- **Establish a Frontline to prevent enemies from moving into our territory**
	- Establishing a frontline protects everything behind it
	- How we do this exactly is highly dependant on the map. Some maps are more flat and open while others feature hills, mountains and/or water
	- The more open/flat a map is, the harder it is to setup a frontline. Raiding units become more important on such a map.
	- Early on, we can more easily achieve this with faster/cheaper units such as pawns/grunts/blitz/incisors. Trying to do this with more expensive/slower units often allows faster units to run around, avoiding these slower units

- **Move your commander out of your Base, towards the center of the territory you're in charge of**
	- It may sound counter intuitive, but the commander is the strongest early game unit and not much can challange it early on, making it a vital peice to controlling space
	- The commander also has a very large amount of build power, and with it, can quickly build mexes, radar and light laser towers
	- In team games, you aren't in charge of defending the entire map. It's important to know what territory you must defend

- **Build Radar in key locations so we can see anything that tries to move into our territory**
	- Radar gets blocked by taller map features. The actual terrain radar can spot is highlighted when trying to place a radar, or once you click on it
	- Building radar on the edge of a hill allows us to detect enemies over shorter obstacles
	- The object is to be able to detect enemies so we can respond more easily to incoming threats before they cause a problem

- **Build Light Laser Towers (LLTs) to help Establish the Frontline and/or Near Key Resources**
	- LLTs won't stop every attack on their own, but they make it more costly for your opponents to attack that location. Paired with fight units, they can often turn the tides of battle
	- On wide open maps, it's much harder to establish a frontline and raids can be abundant. Strategically placing LLTs near mexes (ideally between the mex and the attack angle) will help minimize losses due to raids
	- The more important a location and the more open the map, the more LLTs that should be placed to help maintain the territory
 	- *NOTE: If you have established a strong frontline, building LLTs in the back doesn't make as much sense*.


***Remember, the goal is to control the metal nodes so we have a stronger economy. Having a stronger economy means having more units to destroy our opponents with***

## Map Variations

### If you are unfamililar with a map, take a look around. Map features should affect how you decide to play it.
- If possible, before the match starts, take a close look at the map, mainly the territory you're in charge of.
- Pay attention to these details, they can help or hurt you depending on how well you exploit these features
	- Look for metal reclaim - This usually comes in the form of rocks or metal wrecks
	- Pay attention to how open / closed off parts of the map are, can you use any impassible terrain to your advantage?
		- Note: Bots can run up steeper hills than vehicles
		- Use F2 on default (or F5 on grid) while selecting a unit to show the passibility layer
	- Take a look at how metal nodes are situated, are they more in the middle of the map, or is there plenty outside the middle?

### Hilly maps with Choke Points versus Flat/Open Terrain
- When a map is more confined

### Maps with More Centralized Metal Nodes / Bigger Amounts of Metal
- The more percent of metal in the middle, the more important it is to control it
- This often means sacraficing a touch of early economy to move your commander out of your base very quickly and establishing LLTs so you control this metal, giving you a stronger economy in the end
- When the map does not feature as much metal in the middle, it is not as important to control, and sending your commander out later can mean starting with a stronger backbone of economy

### Some maps have Metal Reclaim
- This often comes in the form of rocks, but you may also see metal wrecks, or special crystals that also hold metal
- In some cases, there is metal in the middle of the map that can help you get an early lead
- When maps have this kind of feature, you may wish to build an early rez bot to reclaim the metal before your opponent does. Opening with a rezbot and a couple pawns/grunts will set your economy back slightly, but the boost of metal can be an important thing to deny from your opponents
