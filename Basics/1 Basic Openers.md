# Basic Openers
<sub></sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sub>

## Fundementals

#### Fundementally, we want to account for several things in our opener
#### By understanding these principles, we should be able to effectively open on any map in any position

### Opening Principles:
- **Take all nearby metal as soon as possible**
     - Metal is often the limiting factor, so it's important to grab the nodes asap, unless you're trying to cheese
     - Sometimes the commander needs to walk to grab more metal. In that case, you can choose to walk or go with fewer starting mexes and get your lab faster
     - It is especially important to grab more metal early if you are planning to open with a vehicle lab, as vehicles cost more metal than bots. If you do not, you may find yourself short on metal as you produce your first few units
- **Make enough energy to never stall**
     - In order to build these faster metal extractors, sometimes energy is needed
     - The important thing is to not stall on energy when building
     - If you do stall, consider options to fix the stalling asap
- **Build a lab to increase build power**
     - The commander can't build everything themselves, it's important to add on constructors to increase building speed and to adding on more resources
- **Anticipate the need for more energy**
     - As a lab finishes, often times we need more energy to utilize the lab properly
     - In most cases, the commander could be adding on more energy production while the lab gets started with constructors or scouts
- **Grab more Metal asap**
     - As constructors come out of the lab, it's important to grab other metal nodes nearby to increase the amount of metal you have coming in

### Map Variations

#### Basic No Wind Starts
- Some maps are moon maps and have no wind, or the wind is too low to utilize properly
- When this is the case, we need to rely on solar for energy production
- NOTE: Solars cost a ton of metal and no energy at all, so it is possible to grab 3 mexes before a solar


| | **4 Metal Node Example** | **3 Metal Node Example** | **2 Metal Node Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 Mex | 3 Mex | 2 Mex |
| 2 | Solar | 2 Solar | 2 Solar |
| 3 | Mex | Lab | Lab |
| 4 | Solar | Solar | Solar |
| 5 | Lab | Assist Lab | Assist Lab |
| 6 | Solar |  |  |
| 7 | Assist Lab |  |  |



#### Adding Low Wind into the Equasion

- On maps with lower wind, wind is still a good option, but purely building only wind early on will take a while to build
- When wind is lower, it is advised to open with at least one solar to help you get started
- Here, since we're still opening with a solar, we can still start with 3 mexes
- NOTE: This opening can vary a lot depending on the actual current wind speed. See below for advice on variations

| | **4 Metal Node Example** | **3 Metal Node Example** | **2 Metal Node Example** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3 Mex | 3 Mex | 2 Mex |
| 2 | Solar | Solar | Solar |
| 3 | Mex | 2 Wind | 2 Wind |
| 4 | 2 Wind | Lab | Lab |
| 5 | Lab | 2 Wind | 2 Wind |
| 6 | 2 Wind | Assist Lab | Assist Lab |
| 7 | Assist Lab |  |  |

#### Adding High Wind into the Equasion

- Some maps have very strong wind and we do not need any solar at all
- Here, since we're opening wind, we should add a wind between a 2nd and 3rd mex. If we do not, we will stall on energy when building the wind turbine.
  *(exceptions exist if the commander needs to walk to grab metal nodes)*

| | **4 Metal Node Example** | **3 Metal Node Example** | **2 Metal Node Example** |
| --- | ---  | ---    | --- |
| 1 | 2 Mex  | 2 Mex  | 2 Mex     |
| 2 | Wind   | Wind   | 3 Wind    |
| 3 | Mex    | Mex    | Lab       |
| 4 | Wind   | 2 Wind | 2 Wind    |
| 5 | Mex    | Lab    | Assist Lab |
| 6 | 2 Wind | 2 Wind |  |
| 7 | Lab    | Assist Lab |  |
| 8 | 2 Wind |  |  |
| 9 | Assist Lab |  |  |

### Variations Based on Actual Wind Speed

- On many maps, wind can vary greatly. Sometimes it is quite good, and other times quite bad.
- For that reason, these "builds" are not set in stone. Feel free to change your plans, BAR is all about adaptation

## After the lab is finished
- We want our commander to assist the lab whenever possible to pump out more build power to help get your base started
- As soon as energy drops lower, add on more energy production to prevent stalling
- 
- As you get used to these mechanics, it is wise to try to anticipate what you'll need and when - but this takes time, be patient. Rome wasn't built in a day.
