### Fundementals

**Fundementally, we want to account for several things in our opener**
**By understanding these principles, we should be able to effectively open on any map in any position**

1) Take all nearby metal as soon as possible
     - No matter if you start with 2 mexes or 4, it's important to build up as much metal first, so that you have more in the long run
3) Make enough energy to never stall
     - In order to build these faster metal extractors, sometimes energy is needed
     - The important thing is to not stall on energy when building
     - If you do stall, consider options to fix the stalling asap
5) Build a lab to increase build power
     - The commander can't build everything themselves, it's important to add on constructors to increase building speed and to adding on more resources
7) Anticipate the need for more energy
     - As a lab finishes, often times we need more energy to utilize the lab properly
     - In most cases, the commander could be adding on more energy production while the lab gets started with constructors or scouts
9) Grab more Metal asap
     - As constructors come out of the lab, it's important to grab other metal nodes nearby to increase the amount of metal you have coming in
