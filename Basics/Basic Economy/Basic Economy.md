## Everything Costs Metal(M) / Energy(E) / Build Time(BT)

#### Metal *(White cost)*
- Must be built on Metal Nodes
- Not all metal nodes are created equally
- Different maps have a different amount of nodes
- Is hardest to obtain because it requires defending a larger territory
- M can be stored easily, so gaining/losing M is slower *(the M bar goes up/down slowly)*
#### Energy *(yellow cost)*
- Most energy structures can be built anywhere
 - There are many different ways to get energy - some ways are more efficient on different maps
 - E isn't as easily stored, so gaining/losing E is faster *(the E bar goes up/down quickly)*
#### Build Time *(green cost)*
- The higher the build time, the longer it takes to be made
- The Actual time it takes to build something depends on how much build power is applied to it
- Constructors can assist constructing buildings from other constructors or factories producing units
- Different constructors/factories have different amount of build power
- The time it takes to build something = Build Time Cost / Build Power applied

<br></br>
### Build Time Calculation

- The time it takes to build something = Build Time Cost / Build Power applied

- If a unit has costs 2000 build time and the factory has 100 build power, it'll take 20 seconds to produce that unit
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000 BT / 100 BP = 20 sec

- The factory can be assisted with a constructor, adding an additional 80 build power, which would produce the unit in 11.11 sec
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000 BT / (100+80) BP = 11.11 sec


#### Assisting a Construction

- To assist a construction, select a constructor (or the commander) and issue a repair order on the unit / building being constructed
	- This can easily be done with a simple RMB click
	- The assistant will idle after finishing the construction

- To assist a constructor/factory itself, select the constructor and issue a guard order on the unit / building being constructed
	- This can also be done with a simple RMB click
	- The assistant will assist the construction/factory until told not to, including following around another constructor
 	- If orders are queued up after a guard order, the order will automatically switch to assisting the current project and will continue with the queued orders afterwards

- Construction Turrets
	- Construction turrets cannot build anything themselves, but will automatically do these things within it's build radius:
		- Assist nearby constructing buildings/units
		- Repair nearby friendly units
		- Reclaim nearby neutral objects
	 - Construction turrets are one of the more efficient ways to add build power to their vicinity
