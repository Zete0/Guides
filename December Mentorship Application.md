# December Mentorship Application

## What is the Mentorship Program?
Mentors are people with a solid core understanding of the game that are willing to help players learn the game. This is often done by:
- Answering questions about the game in #main and #academy-chat
- Analyze replays
- Work one on one with players
- Help build guides
- Participate in running clinics (teaching sessions) and other events
  
Mentors have a special green discord color and symbol *(so be on the lookout for those members if you need assistance)*

## How Do I Become a Mentor?
- For a limited time, we are actively looking for more people for the mentorship program
- To apply, please fill out this [application](https://forms.gle/Kp19twVoqPojS32U8) by <t:1704873600:F>
- **Prospective Mentors __must__ also fill these requirements:**

  **1)** Be a Member of the BAR Community for **4+ Months**

  **2) Be on good terms with the moderation team** (no history of any behavior that could be deemed toxic, no history of harassing community members, no non-appealable moderation action, and BAR / discord must be bridged)

  **3) Show interest** by helping others learn by answering questions within #main and #academy-chat and/or helping with replay reviews dropped in #academy-chat
  
## Mentor Expectations
Mentors are Expected to be capable of:

- Finding and pointing out fundamental issues in someone's play in a friendly manner and be friendly when interacting with the community
- Understanding that not everyone wants help and avoid unsolicited backseating
- Understanding the difference between a mistake and a stylistic choice -
      *(We're not here to force players to play a specific way, but help them with their own style)*
- Not spreading false information - If there is a question you're not sure of, be capable of finding out or stating you're unsure

Mentors are not required to be around 24/7 (this is all voluntary work, not a second job), but should be interested in actively helping people learn the game
