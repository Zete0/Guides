# Watch Good Players
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

#### In order to improve, it is important to watch how other players do things

**To do this, jump into a lobby and click spectate / rejoin**
| Lobby Color | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Green | Open lobbies that haven't started yet |
| Yellow | Open lobbies that have started |
| Blue | Recent lobbies void of players |
| Red | Locked Lobbies |
| Purple | Passworded Lobbies |

*Spectating Yellow lobbies usually requires your client to 'catchup' to the live, on-going game and can take time depending on how long it's been going for*

### Learn from the Best

- Good lobbies to learn from are lobbies marked with a minimum player rating
- Look for players with higher rating
	- To see the player ratings in lobbies, there is a setting *(show path here)*
	- To see the player ratings in games, there is a setting for that too *(show path here)*

 ### Effectively Watching a Player
 
- Click the "Player View" and "Follow Camera" buttons at the bottom left to get their perspective
- It can be hard to follow a player, try to pay attention to one specific aspect of the game
	Example:
 	> - If you're trying to improve / understand your economy, closely watch how they open, what they build and when, and what they reclaim and when.
	> - Pay attention to their resource income and how it affects what economic buildings they build
