# Watch Good Players
<sub></sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sub>

#### In order to improve, it is important to watch how other players do things

**To do this, jump into a lobby and click spectate**
| Lobby Color | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Green | Open lobbies that haven't started yet |
| Yellow | Open lobbies that have started |
| Blue | Recent lobbies void of players |
| Red | Locked Lobbies |

*Spectating Yellow lobbies usually requires your client to 'catchup' to the live, on-going game and can take time depending on how long it's been going for*
