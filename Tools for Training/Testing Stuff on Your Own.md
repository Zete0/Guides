## Testing Stuff on Your Own
<sup><sup>(Author: Zeteo)</sup></sup>

- Testing stuff on your own is a great way to figure out exactly how the game works
- This can allow you to do things such as:
	- Compare Armada / Coretex in game to see how they actually operate
   	- Test how well a new strategy may work
   	- Figure out exactly how a mechanic works


### Setup

- While in a single player lobby (before you hit start), add an inactive AI to the other team with the opposite faction that you choose
- Select a map/adjust the start boxes to match what you'd like
- If you want to test stuff involving blowing up your com for metal, go into advanced options and turn off game ends on commander deaths
- Hit start, the rest of the setup is done in game

#### Single Player Cheats

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/cheat** | Enables cheats to be used in a single player match |
| **/nocost** | Makes all construction cost 1 Metal/Energy/BuildTime |
| **/globallos** | Removes fog of war |
| **/godmode** | Allows the player to control all units, friend or foe |
| **/atm** | Provides 1000 Metal and Energy |
| **/resourcecheat** | Effectively gives your infinite resources |
| **/give \<number\> \<unitname\>** | Spawns in the number of named unit - *NOTE: these names are codenames in the script, and found in the header when looking at unit info* |


**Notes:**
*Some of these are togglable, so if you want to put costs back on, you can just type it in again (existing units produced with /nocost will remain as a cost of 1/1/1)*
*When using godmode, you may not see the the UI of the enemy units*

**If you wish to control both armada / cortex on one player, you can do so by selecting a commander and using the *Capture* ability to add that unit to that player**
