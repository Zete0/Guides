## Increasing Map Awareness

### 3 Things to Check when you have spare time

- Check Your Lane
- Take notice of what you're teammates are doing
- Pay attention to radar blips
- Take notice of what your opponents have if an ally scouts / raids

### Zoom Out / Watch your Minimap

### The Internal Clock
- It may be difficult to remember to watch the minimap / zoom out, there are ways to help yourself with that by setting an internal alarm that goes off every 10 sec or so
	- The idea is to create the habbit of periodically checking things like the minimap / ask yourself what you should be prioritizing
	- When this clock goes off, check yourself - make sure all your ducks are in a row

- To set this internal clock, you could use an actual alarm to help yourself create this habbit
	- Once you have this habbit formed, you can get rid of the actual alarm
 	- This is something I learned while playing starcraft II - When my internal alarm goes off, I know to check the minimap, check my minerals/gas/supply which helped me know what I could actually afford to build and if I needed to build more supply
