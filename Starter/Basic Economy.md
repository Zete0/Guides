# Economy Fundementals

## Everything Costs Metal(M) / Energy(E) / Build Time(BT)

#### Metal *(White cost)*
- Must be built on Metal Nodes
- Not all metal nodes are created equally
- Different maps have a different amount of nodes
- Is hardest to obtain because it requires defending a larger territory
- M can be stored easily, so gaining/losing M is slower *(the M bar goes up/down slowly)*
#### Energy *(yellow cost)*
- Most energy structures can be built anywhere
- There are many different ways to get energy - some ways are more efficient on different maps
- E isn't as easily stored, so gaining/losing E is faster *(the E bar goes up/down quickly)*
#### Build Time *(green cost)*
- The higher the build time, the longer it takes to be made
- The Actual time it takes to build something depends on how much [build power][bp] is applied to it
- Constructors can assist constructing buildings from other constructors or factories producing units
- Different constructors/factories have different amount of build power
- The time it takes to build something = Build Time Cost / Build Power applied
- Build power is considered a third resource

### [id]: Build Power
- Each construction unit has a build power
- The Build power is essentially the amount of work a constructor adds to a project
