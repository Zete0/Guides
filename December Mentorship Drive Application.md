## December Mentorship Drive

### What is the Mentorship Program?
- Mentors are people with a solid core understanding of the game that are willing to help players learn the game
- Mentors help answer questions about the game in #main and #academy-chat, analyze replays, work one on one with players, help build guides, and organize clinics (teaching sessions) and other events
- Mentors have a special green discord color and symbol *(so be on the lookout for those members if you need assistance)*

### How Do I Become a Mentor?
- Right now, we are actively looking for more people for the mentorship program
- To apply, please review [replay link] this replay and submit it to [submission location] by [end date]
- Prospective Mentors must also fill these requirements:

  **1)** Be a Member of the BAR Community for 6+ Months
  
  **2)** Be on good terms with the moderation team (no history of any behavior that could be deemed toxic, no history of harassing community members, no non-appealable moderation action, and not currently debridged)
  
  **3)** Show that you are interested in helping others learn by answering questions within #main and #academy-chat and/or helping with replay reviews

### Mentor Expectations
- Be capable of finding and pointing out fundamental issues in someone's play in a friendly manner
- Be capable of handling delicate social situations in a friendly, diplomatically way
- Understand that not everyone wants help and avoid unsolicited backseating
- Be capable of understanding the difference between a mistake and a stylistic choice -
      *(We're not here to force players to play a specific way, but help them with their own style)*
- Mentors are not required to be around 24/7 (this is all voluntary work, not a second job) and should enjoy helping people learn
