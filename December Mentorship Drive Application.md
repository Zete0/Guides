# December Mentorship Drive

## What is the Mentorship Program?
Mentors are people with a solid core understanding of the game that are willing to help players learn the game. This is often done by:
- Answering questions about the game in #main and #academy-chat
- Analyze replays
- Work one on one with players
- Help build guides
- Participate in running clinics (teaching sessions) and other events
  
Mentors have a special green discord color and symbol *(so be on the lookout for those members if you need assistance)*

## How Do I Become a Mentor?
- For a limited time, we are actively looking for more people for the mentorship program
- To apply, please review [replay link] this replay and submit it to [submission location] by [end date]
- **Prospective Mentors __must__ also fill these requirements:**

  **1)** Be a Member of the BAR Community for 4+ Months
  
  **2)** Be on good terms with the moderation team (no history of any behavior that could be deemed toxic, no history of harassing community members, no non-appealable moderation action, and BAR / discord must be bridged)
  
  **3)** Show that you are interested in helping others learn by answering questions within #main and #academy-chat and/or helping with replay reviews

## Mentor Expectations
Mentors are Expected to be capable of:

- Finding and pointing out fundamental issues in someone's play in a friendly manner
- Handling delicate social situations in a friendly, diplomatic way
- Understanding that not everyone wants help and avoid unsolicited backseating
- Understanding the difference between a mistake and a stylistic choice -
      *(We're not here to force players to play a specific way, but help them with their own style)*
- Not spreading false information - if you don't know something, be able to state you're not sure and try to find out or point to where to get the information

Mentors are not required to be around 24/7 (this is all voluntary work, not a second job), but should be interested in sticking around a while
