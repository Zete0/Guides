Basic Guide to Making Guides




## Notes:

We want 1 general nav page that links to the overview pages?

General how to things work should be in technical or in starter (depending on how technical it is)

Non-Technical guides should be simple to follow and not overly detailed

For now, the guides are just being made, they are overly detailed at the moment and could probably be more concise
Parts of some guides could probably be moved to other areas or in a guide of their own

## Formatting: 

Don't really have a clear format yet
